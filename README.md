## How To Play

### Guess the Wordle in 6 tries.

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
- The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

There are 3 possible statuses:

- <img src="docs/olive.png" width="14" height="14" alt="Olive color"> **misplaced** — this letter does exist in the word, but in a different slot.
- <img src="docs/gray.png" width="14" height="14" alt="Gray color"> **incorrect** — this letter is not found in the word at all.
