## How To Play

### Guess the Wordle in 6 tries.

- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
- The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

There are 3 possible statuses:

- <b style="padding: 2px 5px; color: #fff; background-color: hsl(150deg 70% 30%);">correct</b> — this slot is perfect. It's the right letter in the right place.
- <b style="padding: 2px 5px; color: #fff; background-color: hsl(50deg 100% 30%);">misplaced</b> — this letter does exist in the word, but in a different slot.
- <b style="padding: 2px 5px; color: #fff; background-color: hsl(0deg 0% 25%);">incorrect</b> — this letter is not found in the word at all.
